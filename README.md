# Clustering-and-Fitting
The breast cancer dataset features 32 columns, encompassing key attributes such as patient ID, tumor diagnosis (Malignant or Benign), and a range of tumor characteristics. These characteristics
are detailed in categories like mean values (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter), standard errors, and 'worst' values (the mean of the three largest values) for each attribute. Collectively, these columns
provide a comprehensive profile of each tumour, facilitating in-depth analysis and research in the field of breast cancer diagnostics and treatment.
